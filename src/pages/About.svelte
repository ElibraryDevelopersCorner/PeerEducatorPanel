        <p class="c1"><span class="c6">An Introspective Background</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c8">Peer education </span><span class="c9">is a popular concept that implies an
                approach,
                a communication channel, a methodology, a philosophy, and a strategy. The English term &#39;peer&#39;
                refers
                to &ldquo;one that is of equal standing with another; one belonging to the same societal group,
                especially
                based on age, grade or status&rdquo;. The term &#39;education&#39; refers to the
                &ldquo;development&rdquo;,
                &ldquo;training&rdquo;, or &ldquo;persuasion&rdquo; of a given person or thing, or the
                &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; resulting from the educational process. This concept is introduced by CBSE in
                academic year 2021-22</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c9">Why Peer Education?</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c9">Trained peer educators are a more credible source of information for some youth
                than
                are adult educators because they communicate in readily understandable ways and serve as positive role
                models while dispelling misperceptions that most youths are problematic.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c8">PIS Sangli</span><span class="c9">, always supports new ways to education. Peer
                education panel was formed under the guidance of Principal Sir, Mr. G.B. Patil. (Under SDP priority 2 ,
                Behavior and personality development, school has started this initiative).</span></p>

        <p class="c1"><span class="c9">The peer education program is implemented at two levels in the school. The
                first</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c9">level is the selection and training of peer leaders. The second level is the
                conduction of schedule by the peer leaders in the school. The peer leaders were selected on the
                following
                attributes: expressing oneself, interest in group activity, leadership ability, self-confidence,
                creativity
                and knowledge of community issues.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c8">Peer educator panel was formed</span><span class="c9">. After forming the panel,
                higher grade students came up with a lesson plan and they themselves had designed student&rsquo;s skill
                development plan. Later they improvised the idea of tutoring 527 new students. During bridge course,
                daily 1
                hour, they contributed for the same. Objective behind it was to make new students comfortable and
                develop
                skill. Tutoring plan was totally activity based and followed the lesson plan which was designed by the
                students under the guidance of the teachers.</span></p>
